# Goals

The application I have chosen for this project is a weight tracking app. This app has one major goal and that is to track the weight of its user. This app will have databases for storing daily weight, storing login and passwords N store their ideal weight. The app will consist of a logging in screen and on the home screen of the app will be a grid layout displaying daily weights and the days they were entered in. There will also be a mechanism for adding daily weight as well as a goal weight. The app will also consist of notification settings to track progress and notify when their ideal weight has been met.

# UI Design

UI Design: the screens and features that will be necessary for the app and a user centered UI design are listed below for a high-level breakdown.

-the first screen built for the app is a logging in screen and we'll prompt the user for a login and password.

-The second screen will consist of a grid layout with displays for daily weights and the days that they were entered. This screen may also show encouraging words, phrases and comments about their track.

-a third screen will show user profile information. This information may allow for entering sex and age in order to help calculate a BMI that could also be displayed on the second screen. 

# Testing

I ensured my code worked by testing and debugging often. Using the built in tests from Android Studio helped me in this process.

# Challenges

I had to overcome challenges when dealing with the programming of the tools and databases. Research and reading lead to some solutions. Using the tools in hand to solve the issues where important in success of the app.

# Experience

I excelled at creating the UI of the app and laying out an easy to use and functional app. Simplistic layouts are sometimes the most efficient and also what the user wants.
